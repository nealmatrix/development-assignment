# C++ Development Assignment

Research on the [Google FlatBuffers projects](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) and work on following tasks:

- Write a sample schema that can represent a property tree (property name, property value, property type, and sub-properties).
- Write code snippets in C++ that can read/update on the property object generated by the FlatBuffers compiler.
- Write code snippets in C++ that can send/receive the property object over TCP socket.
- Write code snippets in C++ that use the reflection API to read from the TCP socket and iterate over the elements stored inside the property tree.
- Consider the property tree will be updated frequently by the sender, think of a solution that synchronize the updates to the receiver.
