# C++ Development Assignment

Research on the [Google FlatBuffers projects](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) and work on following tasks:

- Write a sample schema that can represent a property tree (property name, property value, property type, and sub-properties).
- Write code snippets in C++ that can read/update on the property object generated by the FlatBuffers compiler.
- Write code snippets in C++ that can send/receive the property object over TCP socket.
- Write code snippets in C++ that use the reflection API to read from the TCP socket and iterate over the elements stored inside the property tree.
- Consider the property tree will be updated frequently by the sender, think of a solution that synchronize the updates to the receiver.

### Task 1

- build flatc compiler tool
```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/flatbuffers.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```
- write a sample schema: property.fbs and define property object
- compile the property schema
```bash
../open_sources/flatbuffers/build/flatc --cpp property.fbs
```
